\section{Introduction}
At its core Very Long Baseline Interferometry (\gls{vlbi}) is an interferometry process where the output from several radio antennae are 
combined, to form an equivalent output to a telescope of the size equal to the distance between the furthest two antennae in the \gls{vlbi} array. These
arrays spans over very large areas or entire continents. For a comprehensive overview of the technique the reader is referred to the detailed introduction 
by Middelberg et al. \cite{middelberg2008high}. Several such extended arrays exist including the European VLBI network and the Very Long Baseline Array. The 
hope is to include the KAT-7 in future VLBI observations.

Traditionally the process required raw data to be dumped to a storage medium, say tape, and physically shipped to a correlator where the data from several 
telescopes could be combined. The new trend in VLBI is to perform real-time correlation between antennae using high-speed internet connections and is known
as 'eVLBI'. Both the Australian Long Baseline Array and the European VLBI network have performed successful eVLBI observations.

Ultimately the problem being investigated (at least in part by this report) can be boiled down to converting data sent over the SPEAD protocol (employed 
internally by the KAT-7 array) to the VDIF format. This conversion process includes a necessary first step, where the current sampling rate of 800 MHz
\footnote{According to the KAT-7 Data Interface document} is reduced to 128 MHz through \textit{Digital Downconversion}. The basic operation involves the following three
steps:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Mixing. Where the signal is shifted down to \textit{baseband} (frequency 0 of the spectrum), by mixing the signal with a Local Oscillator (\gls{lo}).
 The \gls{lo} is simply a generated sine wave with its frequency equal to the lower end of the sub-spectrum to be extracted. Mixing is achieved through an 
 element-wise multiplication of the original signal with the \gls{lo} tone. In essence mixing is not a \textit{linear} (refer to \cite[ch. 5]{smith1997scientist}) 
 process. If $f$ was a single channel in the frequency domain then mixing produces replicated channels at $f - f_{lo}$ and $f + f_{lo}$.
 \item Filtering. In order to eliminate aliasing in the frequency domain, due to mixing and frequencies above the new sampling rate, a Finite Impulse Response 
 (\gls{fir}) filter with its cutoff set at the rate $\frac{1}{2}f_{decimated}$ is used to comply with the Nyquest sampling theorem (see \cite[ch. 3]{smith1997scientist}).
 \item Interpolation and Decimation. The reader is referred to \url{http://www.dspguru.com/dsp/faqs/multirate/basics} for an overview of the process.  
\end{enumerate}

There is, however, a further complication to deal with, before this downconversion process can begin: the KAT-7 beamformer produces a series of frequency spectra. If no filtering 
was applied to these spectra, the undo operation would only have involved applying the inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (\gls{dft}). However, the original voltage data went 
through a filter-bank operation, in a process known as the Polyphase Filter Bank (\gls{pfb}). This method is also known as the Weighted Window Overlap method and is necessary for computing 
Short Time Discrete Fourier Transforms on subsections of very long signals. The reader is referred to \url{https://casper.berkeley.edu/wiki/The_Polyphase_Filter_Bank_Technique} for a detailed 
description on the forward \gls{pfb} process.

This report first discusses the validation techniques we employed to test both the construction of the analysis and synthesis filter banks of the \gls{pfb} and inverse \gls{pfb}, 
along with the validation of our GPU code. We then provide an overview of our design and optimization techniques for the GPU version of the filter bank, before discussing the quality of 
the reconstructed signal and GPU performance.
\section{Analysis and design}
\subsection{Validation of the forward and inverse processes}
The forward \gls{pfb} process can be thought of as a very basic analysis filter bank, whereas the inverse process can be thought of as a synthesis filter bank. The 
analysis filter bank uses a Hamming-windowed \gls{fir} with $P=8$ banks of $N=1024$ elements, with no up- or down-sampling stages \footnote{According to information provided by Jason Manley}.
Our implementation focuses on 8-bit-sized samples produced by the KAT-7 beamformer \footnote{According to the KAT-7 Data Interface document}, but could easily adapted to other sample-sizes,
as well as prototype filter lengths.

The key differences between the analysis and synthesis processes are:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item If $H[n]$ is the prototype FIR filter and the analysis filter bank uses the subfilters $H_1[n], H_2[n] \dots H_P[n]$, each of length $N$, then the synthesis filter bank
 uses the subfilters $\bar H_1[N-n-1], \bar H_2[N-n-1] \dots \bar H_P[N-n-1]$\footnote{Findings published in an in-house final technical report titled 'A review of polyphase filter 
 banks and their application'. Daniel Zhou. Air Force Research Laboratory, Information Directorate, Rome Research Site, Rome, New York}.
 \item The commutator is flipped around (as shown on page 10 of Zhou's report) and therefore the subfilters should be processed in reverse order.
\end{enumerate}

We've implemented both the basic analysis and synthesis filter banks, as well as the necessary tools to analyse the performance of this basic filter bank construction. As shown in 
figure~\ref{filtered_and_unfiltered_analysis} the analysis filter bank successfully limits leakage of any frequencies that lie between neighboring bin centers of the \gls{dft}.
This confirms that our basic analysis filter bank construction is correct.
\begin{figure}[h]

 \begin{subfigure}{0.5\textwidth}

  \caption{Filtered analysis filter bank}
 \end{subfigure}
\caption[\gls{dft} Leakage]{Example of \gls{dft} leakage. It is clear that the unfiltered analysis filter bank suffers severely when containing frequencies even slightly off the bin centers
	 of the \gls{dft}. Its filtered counterpart produces crisp binning of both centered and uncentered frequencies.}
\label{filtered_and_unfiltered_analysis}
\end{figure}

The synthesis filter bank construction was tested through cross correlation with the original input signal. A surefire way of determining if there is a 
correlation between the input and the output of the sythesis filter bank, is to use Gaussian noise as input signal. Perfect Reconstruction (\gls{pr}) requires that the signal 
only varies in the following two ways:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item The output signal may be shifted by some $\Delta$ time steps.
 \item The output signal may be scaled by a constant.
\end{enumerate}

The signal shift may be found by the following method (where $x[t]$ is the input to the analysis filter and $y[t]$ is the output of the synthesis filter):
\begin{equation}
 \Delta=\underset{t}{argmax}(x[t]\star y[t])
\end{equation}

According to Parishwad Vaidyanathan \cite{vaidyanathan1990multirate} this basic filter bank cannot achieve \gls{pr} and have to be modified in order to do so. This involves 
modifying both the analysis and synthesis filter banks. In our situation this is not plausible, since only the basic form of analysis filter bank is implemented 
on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (\gls{fpga}) in the current production environment. This is due to their simple construction and \textit{fast evaluation times} \cite{vaidyanathan1990multirate}. 
Vaidyanathan goes on to state, however, that the synthesis filter bank requires subfilters of much greater length to obtain reasonably good reconstruction and is therefore computationally prohibiting. That 
said, as the reader can see from figure~\ref{correlation}, $x[t]\star y[t]$ shows that our basic synthesis filter bank achieves limited reconstruction.

\begin{figure}
 \begin{subfigure}{0.5\textwidth}
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{x_cor.png}
  \caption{Cross correlation between $x[t]$ and $y[t]$}
 \end{subfigure}
 \begin{subfigure}{0.5\textwidth}
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{auto_cor.png}
  \caption{Auto correlation of $x[t]$}
 \end{subfigure}
\caption[Correlation between synthesis filter bank and input]{It is clear that even for Gaussian noise the synthesis filter bank achieves a limited reconstruction - the correlation between the reconstructed- and 
input signals is about 6 times weaker than the auto correlation of the input signal. The reader should also notice that it appears that $\Delta = -N\dot (P-1)$. This observation was made for 
trials with input signals of different lengths, but we have not rigorously proven this, and it should not be taken as a fact. Future expansion, testing and debugging should use
the cross correlation to determine $\Delta$.}
\label{correlation}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Validation of the GPU version}
We will, for now, only focus on the most basic filter bank construction to determine what throughput rates can be achieved, as well as the quality of the reconstruction. The full source code
along with test and analysis suite should be included with this report. With this suite the C++ CUDA GPU code can be validated against a serial python implementation. The reader 
should have GCC 4.6 installed, along with the NVIDIA NVCC compiler toolkit 5.0 redistributable. Although the code should work on any platform, we have only tested this under 
recent GNU/Linux kernels. Another requirement is that the user have a GPU of Compute Capability $\geq2.0$ installed on their system. In order to run the test suite the user should have 
Python 2.7 along with the SciLab suite of packages installed (including NumPy, SciPy and MatplotLab).

In order to validate that the GPU version is in fact producing valid results we've tested it against the output of our Python synthesis filter bank. The Mean Squared Error 
is defined as:
\begin{equation}
 MSE(input_1,input_2) := \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{L-1}{(input_1[k] - input_2[k])^2}}{L} \text{ where } ||input_1|| = ||input_2|| = L
\end{equation}

By generating 0.976 GiB of Gaussian noise we determined the characteristics of the two output files, as shown in table~\ref{validation_gpu}
\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Python Synthesis Bank} & \textbf{GPU Synthesis Bank} \\
    \hline
    $\bar x$ & -0.000307 & -0.000307 \\
    \hline
    $\sigma$ & 2.969016 & 2.969015 \\
    \hline
    \textbf{Mean Squared Error} & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\textbf{0.000001}} \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption[Validation of the GPU version]{Results from validating the GPU version against the serial python version of the synthesis filter bank}
  \label{validation_gpu}
\end{table}

This subtle difference between the output files may be attributed to both floating-point rounding errors and the fact that we have discarded the last non-redundant
sample of \gls{fft} output (explained shortly). Different \gls{fft} implementations may behave differently under this situation and may produce slightly different results. 
It should be noted that here the GPU has processed the file in several batches as we will explain next.

\subsection{Optimizations on the GPU-accelerated synthesis filter bank}
The GPU version has been constructed with the requirements of real-time operation in mind. Although it has not been integrated into a SPEAD receiver, the device simply has
to be initialized once. The GPU will allocate all the memory it requires during this initialization process, after which the user can send batches, of any size, 
off to the GPU for processing. The user can send these batches on a rolling bases, as long as one batch is fully processed before the next batch is started. The GPU inverts 
all the \gls{dft}s in a combined operation and keeps track of the last $P\times N$ $N$-sized inverse \gls{dft}s. This is achieved by keeping a persistent buffer between batches. 
The only hard constraint placed on this batching process is that the size of the batch is an integral multiple of $\frac{N}{2}$ (the length of each analysis spectrum as mentioned earlier). At 
this point we wish to make the reader aware of subtlety in the output data received from the beamformers. Although a real-valued inverse \gls{dft} will require $\frac{N}{2}+1$ non-redundant 
samples to perform a computation, the last frequency bin is discarded before we receive it. The author has assumed $X_{filtered}[f=\frac{N}{2}+1] = 0$ in his construction 
of the analysis and synthesis filterbanks.

Care has been taken in optimizing the GPU code according to the architectural requirements of GPUs: 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Memory copies to and from the device is done in batches to improve latency
 \item Memory accesses have been coalesced, including necessary padding to align memory to the 128 byte memory boundaries of Compute Capability 2.0. This constant 
 can be adjusted for newer architectures if necessary. At this point we should warn the reader that $N$ must be a multiple of 128 for this coalescing scheme to function
 as intended.
 \item Memory transfers to and from the GPU have been optimized by pinning host memory to primary memory so that it does not get paged out to disk by the memory 
 controller of the host operating system.
 \item \gls{dft}s are computed in batches using the NVIDIA CUFFT libraries using \gls{fft}s.
 \item CUDA streams are used to run kernels and memory copies asynchronously whenever possible. This adds an additional level of parallelism to the solution.
 \item We investigated using the cached texture memory of the GPU to store the prototype \gls{fir} filter coefficients. This did not provide greater throughputs compared to
 coalesced global memory accesses. We note for future reference that it is probably not worthwhile copying these filter taps to constant device memory, as this memory only 
 provides better throughputs when multiple threads (usually either a half-warp or warp of 32 threads) access the same element simultaneously. This is not true in our situation, and
 using constant memory will result in serialization of the entire group of threads!
 \item In compliance with the limitations of compute capability 2.0\footnote{Compute Capability 2.0 accepts a maximum of 65536 blocks per grid dimension} devices we split the 
 number of blocks being executed in each grid between the $Dim_x$ and $Dim_y$ dimensions of the grid.
 \item As it stands the computations of the basic synthesis filter bank did not require the use of shared memory. If kernels are added at a latter stage care should be taken
 to avoid bank-conflicts between warps of threads. The reader is referred to GPU Gems 3 \cite[ch. 3]{harris2007parallel} for a short introduction to this architectural constraint.
\end{enumerate}

The user should manually tweak the memory allocation to fulfill their needs. All these constants are defined in the header file {\verb inv_pfb.h }. It should be pointed out that 
the card should be completely filled with data in order to achieve good occupancy and offset the comparatively slow memory transfers through the PCI express bus.

\section{Results and discussion}
\subsection{Reconstruction quality}
In order to asses the quality of reconstruction we used Gaussian noise as input to the analysis filter bank and measured the reconstruction factor. Our results 
corroborates the literature surrounding filterbank construction, but does show that we achieve limited reconstruction. That said, there is a reasonable correlation 
between the input and the output of the synthesis filter bank. This can be confirmed by visual inspection of the (time-shifted) output of the synthesis filter bank.

The reconstruction factor is calculated in the following manor ($x[t]$ is the input Gaussian noise and $y[t]$ is the output of the synthesis filter bank).
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Assume $y[t]=c(x[t]c_{ax} + n[t]c_{an})$ where $c_{ax}^2+c_{an}^2 = 1$, ie. the reconstructed signal will consist of the scaled sum of scaled input and scaled noise.
 \item An estimate of $c$ is given by $c^{est}=\frac{\sigma_{y[t]}}{\sigma_{x[t]}}$
 \item An estimate of $c_{ax}$ is given by $c_{ax}^{est}=\max{(x[t]\star y[t])}\times(c^{est})^{-1}\times(\max{(x[t]\star x[t])})^{-1}$
 \item The reconstruction ratio is defined as $\frac{\sqrt{2}c_{ax}^{est}}{\sqrt{1+(c_{ax}^{est})^2}}$
\end{enumerate}

Table~\ref{tab_quality} shows that, although the synthesis filterbank has degraded a significant portion of the signal, strong sources will still be observed. Faint
sources will require a combination of longer observation and/or longer synthesis filters.

\subsection{GPU Computational performance}
We have recorded performance measurements on a Tesla M2090 and a single core (Python implementation) of a AMD Opteron 6274 clocked at 2200 MHz with 128 GiB primary memory, 
clocked at 1333 MHz. These timings include memory transfer costs between the host and the GPU. It would be considered an unfair comparison if they were neglected.

  file, of almost 4 GiB, the throughput increases to 8.20 Gbps - more than a 273x speedup! These rates well exceeds the requirements for real-time synthesis. It does, however, 
  show that the GPU memory should be saturated with data in order to offset the memory transfer between the host and device.}
  \label{computation_times}
\end{figure}

Although this speedup seems remarkably good the author wants to caution the reader that, ideally, the optimized GPU version should be compared to an parallel optimized CPU
version. Not only can we easily parallelize this algorithm using OpenMP, but there is also opportunity here to exploit the full parallel capabilities of modern CPUs,
by making use of the special vectorized instruction sets like Intel/AMD Streaming SIMD Extensions or Intel Adanced Vector eXtensions. The latter can perform up to 8 32-bit 
floating-point operations per core simultaneously, by loading 8 elements into special 256-bit register at a time. This approach, coupled with higher CPU clock speeds may reduce this speedup 
significantly if executed on an 8 or 16 core server CPU, and by extension the latest Intel Xeon Phi co-processors.

\section{Future work}
There is a clear need for an investigation into extending the lengths of the subfilters in order to obtain better a signal reconstruction. The filterbank operation has complexity 
of $O(n)$. Therefore it is reasonable to assume that if the subfilters are expanded by a constant factor the computation time will also increase in a linear fashion. The author 
notes that this will require a slight adjustment in both the Python and GPU implementations where the number of \gls{fft} bins and subfilter lengths are not assumed to be equal, 
as per the basic construction.
